# PbPbTopAnalysis

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:LuukVermunt/PbPbTopAnalysis.git PbPbTopAnalysis
```

## Note

```
This are all the important macro's I used during my summer project at CERN in 2016

1) Note that most of the scripts were using local root-files. You have to edit these path names.
2) Did not test if all the links are still right. It can be that you have to edit some include statements.
```
